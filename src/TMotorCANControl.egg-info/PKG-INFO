# TMotorCANControl
A Python API for controlling the AK-series Tmotor Actuators from CubeMars over the CAN bus.
The project is geared towards the control of the AK80-9 actuator using a raspberry pi CAN hat or serial bus, but
could eaisly be adapted for use with a different CAN/serial interface. The API files are in the src/TMotorCANControl
folder in this repository. The main interface is in the file TMotorManager_mit_can.py for MIT mode, 
TMotorManager_servo_can.py for Servo mode (over CAN), and TMotorManager_servo_serial for Servo mode (over serial). 
Sample scripts can be found in the demos folder. 

For video instructions on setting up the motor, see the CubeMars tutorials on 
[Yoyo Liu's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJBJhivWqxE).
For written instructions on setting up the motor and configuring the pi, see 
[these instructions](https://opensourceleg.com/cubemars-tmotor-control-method/) on the Open Source Leg website.

## API Usage
For some code examples, see the demos folder in this repository. 
For the full API documentation, see [our page on ReadTheDocs](https://tmotorcancontrol.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
These examples make use of the soft_real_timeloop class from the [NeuroLocoMiddleware library](https://pypi.org/project/NeuroLocoMiddleware/) 
for the control loops, but the library could be used without this dependancy. 

The TMotorManager_mit_can, TMotorManager_servo_can, and TMotorManager_servo_serial classes are in the TMotorManager module in the TMotorCANControl package. The intended use case would be to declare a TMotorManager_mit_can, TMotorManager_servo_can, or TMotorManager_servo_serial object in a block, and then write your controller within 
that block, in order to ensure the motor is powered on when in use and powered off if an error is thrown or the 
program ends. 

To control a motor that has been set up for MIT control over the CAN bus,
you can create a [TMotorManager_mit_can object](https://tmotorcancontrol.readthedocs.io/en/latest/TMotorCANControl.html#TMotorCANControl.mit_can.TMotorManager_mit_can), 
as shown below for an AK80-9 with CAN ID 3. 
```python
from TMotorCANControl.TMotorManager_mit_can import TMotorManager_mit_can
with TMotorManager_mit_can(motor_type='AK80-9', motor_ID=3) as dev:
    dev.update()
```

To control a motor that has been set up for Servo control over the CAN bus, 
you can create a [TMotorManager_servo_can object](https://tmotorcancontrol.readthedocs.io/en/latest/TMotorCANControl.html#TMotorCANControl.servo_can.TMotorManager_servo_can),
as shown below for an AK80-9 with CAN ID 3.
```python
from TMotorCANControl.TMotorManager_servo_can import TMotorManager_servo_can
with TMotorManager_servo_can(motor_type='AK80-9', motor_ID=3) as dev:
    dev.update()
```

To control a motor that has been set up for MIT control over the CAN bus,
you can create a [TMotorManager_servo_serial object](https://tmotorcancontrol.readthedocs.io/en/latest/TMotorCANControl.html#TMotorCANControl.servo_serial.TMotorManager_servo_serial), 
as shown below
for an AK80-9 on usb serial port 'dev/tty/USB0', with baud rate 921600 (the default).
```python
from TMotorCANControl.TMotorManager_servo_serial import TMotorManager_servo_serial
with TMotorManager_servo_serial(port='/dev/ttyUSB0', baud=921600, motor_params=Servo_Params_Serial['AK80-9']) as dev:
    dev.update()
```

The motor can be controlled in a variety of modes, depending on which communication setup you are using, as shown below.

| Control Mode                               | MIT CAN | Servo CAN | Servo Serial |
| -----------                                | ------- | --------- | -----------  |
| Current                                    | yes     | yes       | yes          |
| Velocity                                   | yes     | yes       | yes          |
| Position                                   | yes     | yes       | yes          |
| Duty Cycle                                 | no      | yes       | yes          |
| Impedance with feedforward Current         | yes     | no        | no           |
| Position with velocity/acceleration limits | no      | yes       | yes          |

Once entered, the motor can be controlled in any of these modes by setting the TMotorManager's
internal command, and then calling the update() method to send the command. The values of the
internal command can be set with the following methods, if available for the communication
protocol you are using.

- set_output_angle_radians(pos): Sets the position command to "pos" radians.
- set_motor_current_qaxis_amps(current): Sets the current command to "current" amps.
- set_duty_cycle_percent(duty): (only in servo mode, CAN or serial) Set the duty cycle to the specified percentage ratio, between 0 and 1. 
- set_output_torque_newton_meters(torque): Sets the current command based on the torque supplied.
- set_output_velocity_radians_per_second(vel): Sets velocity command to "vel" rad/s.
- set_motor_torque_newton_meters(torque): Sets torque command based on the torque specified, adjusted for the gear ratio to control motor-side torque.
- set_motor_angle_radians(pos): Sets position command based on the position specified, adjusted for the gear ratio to control motor-side position.
- set_motor_velocity_radians_per_second(vel): Sets velocity command based on the velocity specified, adjusted for the gear ratio to control motor-side velocity.

Furthermore, the motor state can be accessed with the following methods. The state is updated
every time the update() method is called, which are pretty self explanitory.
- get_current_qaxis_amps()
- get_output_angle_radians()
- get_output_velocity_radians_per_second()
- get_output_acceleration_radians_per_second_squared()
- get_output_torque_newton_meters()
- get_motor_angle_radians()
- get_motor_velocity_radians_per_second()
- get_motor_acceleration_radians_per_second_squared()
- get_motor_torque_newton_meters()
- get_motor_error_code()

The following are available only for servo mode over the serial bus:
- get_current_daxis_amps()
- get_current_bus_amps()
- get_voltage_qaxis_volts()
- get_voltage_daxis_volts()
- get_voltage_bus_volts()

The getters and setters above are also combined into properties for ease of use.

- current_qaxis: q-axis current in Amps
- position: output angle in rad (after gearbox)
- velocity: output velocity in rad/s (after gearbox)
- acceleration: output acceleration in rad/s/s (after gearbox)
- torque: output torque in Nm (after gearbox)
- position_motorside: motor-side angle in rad (before gearbox)
- velocity_motorside: motor-side velocity in rad/s (before gearbox)
- acceleration_motorside: motor-side acceleration in rad/s/s (before gearbox)
- torque_motorside: motor-side torque in Nm (before gearbox)

And for servo mode over the serial bus only:
- current_daxis: d-axis current in Amps
- current_bus: input current in Amps
- voltage_qaxis: q-axis voltage in Volts
- voltage_daxis: d-axis voltage in Volts
- voltage_bus: input voltage in Volts

Another notable function is the zero_position() function, which sends a command to the motor to 
zero it's current angle. This function will shut off control of the motor for about a half second
while the motor zeros (sort of like zeroing a scale, it seems to record a few points to get 
a good measurement). As such, after calling the method you should delay for at least 500 ms
if timely communication is important.

The following example would instantiate a TMotorManager for an AK80-9 motor with a CAN ID of 3,
logging into a CSV file named "log.csv", with the full set of log variables specified above. Then
it will zero the motor position and wait long enough for the motor to be done zeroing. Finally,
it will enter impedance control mode with gains of 10Nm/rad and 0.5Nm/(rad/s). It then will set 
the motor position to 3.14 radians until the program is exited.

```python
with TMotorManager_mit_can(motor_type='AK80-9', motor_ID=3) as dev:
    dev.set_zero_position()
    time.sleep(1.5)
    dev.set_impedance_gains_real_unit(K=10,B=0.5)
    loop = SoftRealtimeLoop(dt = 0.01, report=True, fade=0)

    for t in loop:
        dev.update()
        dev.position = 3.14
```
